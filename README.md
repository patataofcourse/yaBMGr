# yaBMGr (Yet Another BMG Reader)
Made specifically for DS games. Currently only supports UTF-16LE, and reads files in little endian (because DS).
If you're looking to edit BMG files faster, use [ndspy](https://pypi.org/project/ndspy) instead. This is made to export them to a custom format, mainly for use with Git and easier version tracking.

## Requirements:
* click

## Note:
I didn't bother to add custom errors (<.<) so say hi to python exceptions :D
